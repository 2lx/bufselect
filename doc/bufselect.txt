3. Usage					*bufselect-usage* *:Bufselect*

The command :Bufselect opens a popup menu with a list of names of buffers in
the Vim buffer list (|:buffers|). When you press <Enter> on a buffer name, the
buffer is opened. If the selected buffer is already opened in a window, the
cursor will move to that window.  If the buffer it not present in any of the
windows, then the selected buffer will be opened in the current window.  You
can use the up and down arrow keys to move the currently selected entry in the
popup menu.

In the popup menu, you can type a series of characters to narrow down the list
of displayed buffer names. The characters entered so far is displayed in the
popup menu title. You can press backspace to erase the previously entered set
of characters. The popup menu displays all the buffer names containing the
series of typed characters.

You can close the popup menu by pressing the escape key or by pressing CTRL-C.

In the popup menu, the complete directory path to a buffer is displayed in
parenthesis after the buffer name. If this is too long, then the path is
shortened and an abbreviated path is displayed.

In the popup menu, the following keys can be used:

    CTRL-F	- Scroll one page forward
    <PageDown>	- Scroll one page forward
    CTRL-B	- Scroll one page backward
    <PageUp>	- Scroll one page backward
    CTRL-Home	- Jump to the first entry
    CTRL-End	- Jump to the last entry
    <Up>	- Go up one entry
    <Down>	- Go down one entry
    <Enter>	- Open the selected buffer
    <Esc>	- Close the popup menu
    <CTRL-C>	- Close the popup menu

Any other alphanumeric key will be used to narrow down the list of names
displayed in the popup menu.
